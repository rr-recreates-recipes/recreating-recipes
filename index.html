    <h2 id="welcome">welcome to my culinary diaries</h2>
    <p class="navy-text">With simple origins dating back to 2017, <strong>RR Cooking Diaries</strong> has since evolved to welcome my newly acquired baking and making skills, Naturally, this has led to a series of visual step-by-step instructions featured on my Instagram stories, known under the hashtag 'RR Recreates Recipes' – thanks to a global lockdown, that's now well into Q1/2021.</p>
    <p class="navy-text">Such "unprecedented times" have seen our days inundated with a wave of emotions, felt the world over. Yet, if there's a miniscule, however fleeting, silver lining somewhere, it's the luxury of time to truly indulge in both passions and hobbies – that, until now, were gathering dust, while living rent-free in the back of my mind.</p>
    <p class="navy-text">Dancing with abandon (pure joy!); escaping into the worlds of some strikingly simple yet utterly complex, in-the-grey characters, imagined by Indian literary icons (Rabindranath Tagore, Sudha Murty, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni); gazing at the night sky (hi Ursula Major, Venus, SpaceX 'Starlink' satellites, and bright but blink-and-you'll-miss-it meteorites!); practising daily early morning kapalbhati pranayama (#yoga); Netflix'ing and Prime'ing ('McMafia' s1, 'Startup' s1-s3, 'Emily in Paris' s1); listening to the transcendental sounds of Indian classical/folk music (Soumik Datta on the sarod and 'Baul' by fashion brand Raw Mango's 'Ghar Sounds' playlist is a must); getting through bookmarked podcasts (up next is the BoF's 'Inside the Magic and Math of Digital Marketing'); and finally taking up long-awaited coding classes in HTML and CSS! It's been refreshing, sublime, and humbling in equal doses.</p>
    <p class="navy-text">But for a moment, let's return to my rising interest and passion in cooking, baking, and making. The chemistry and marriage of complementary ingredients to form something so wonderfully satisfying to the palate, is truly fascinating and, moreover, therapeutic. Hailing from an Indian family of ex-restaurateurs, well-known for hosting some epic home summer BBQs in recent years, it's only natural that I'd embrace a culinary interest of sorts sooner or later.</p>
    <p class="navy-text">This coupled with recently learned coding skills, brings me to this one-page website – to help showcase a peek into my diaries aka #RRRecreatesRecipes. As the diary medium would imply, every recipe shown here is an honest, raw, first attempt. Indeed, the journey has not been without its instances of accidental omissions of a few ingredients (thankfully, without compromising on taste). But it's important to remain real, authentic, and transparent. So, please enjoy reading and viewing. And thank you for your kind, encouraging words of feedback in my Instagram DMs.</p>
    <p class="navy-text">Much appreciated, and much love! RR x</p>

  <p class="blue-text">Before we head to the main event, let's take a quick look at some of the culinary delights I've rustled up to date, courtesy of one of my go-to eateries: Dishoom. A modern day food & hospitality brand behind a series of UK-based Indian restaurants – each inspired by the scores of Parsi cafés that used to decorate the street-corners of 1960s Bombay. While only a handful of its Indian counterparts stand as proud icons of a bygone era, Dishoom is much-loved at eight restaurants (and counting!); complete with a recently refurbished flagship in Covent Garden, London. And continues to draw inspiration from the ethos of Parsi cafés, which (sub)consciously sought to break down barriers and unite all in the name of humanity, no matter the occasion.</p>
  <p class="blue-text">Indeed, Dishoom has played host to many of my memories and milestones: breakfasts, graduation dinner, first dates, Raksha Bandhan, Diwali, team Christmas dinner, and casual family catch-ups, to name a few (pictured below). Great food shared with equally great company over hearty laughter truly warms the soul. So, when Dishoom welcomed us further into its world with a cookbook on 5 September 2019, my mum quite aptly gifted a copy on my birthday. And just like that, over a 100 Dish(oom)es were transported from the restaurant's marble tables to my kitchen worktop. Recreated recipes include firm favourites at Dishoom: Gunpowder Potatoes, Okra Fries, Mattar Paneer, Masala (Chocolate) Chai, and Chicken Ruby!</p>
